# CNN on MNIST dataset with various architectures 

CNN with different architectures.

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

MNIST sample images.
Sample images from MNIST test dataset.
The MNIST database contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.


I experimented with different Architectures are :
 
 1) 3 conv. layers with different kernel size.
 
 2) 5 conv. layers with different kernel size. 
 
 3) 7 conv. layers with different kernel size.
